Tetris (1984) was the first videogame to be exported from the USSR to the US, going on to sell 170 million copies. We're going to make some Tetris blocks, first turn the stroke off **type** `stroke 0`\n2. Next move your cursor to the start of the first block **type** `moveTo 150,200`\n3. We're going to need some colors to tell the blocks apart, change the fill color of your shapes with the color function **type** `color crimson`\n4. First we're going to draw an L shaped block **type** `rectangle 50,150`\n5. Our blocks are all going to be to a 50x50 grid, so you'll notice all our draw and move commands are multiples of 50  **type** `move 0,100`\n6. Finish off the block with a 100,50 `rectangle`\n7.

Finally fill in the foot **type** `rectangle 50,100`\n\n#### What you’ll hack\nNow you’ve made a cube, give each tetrimino whatever color you want, and add in more.\n\n#### Briefing \nTetris (1984) was the first videogame to be exported from the USSR to the US, going on to sell 170 million copies. We're going to make some Tetris blocks, which are known as tetriminos. Each tetrimino is made up of four squares that connect together, and fit together in interesting ways. In the game, tetriminos fall down endlessly and the goal is to make as many of them fit together without empty spaces.\n"
