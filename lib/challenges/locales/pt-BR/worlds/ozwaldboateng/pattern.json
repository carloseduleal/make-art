			"hint": "Our pattern is created by circles inside of circles, which we’ll draw using a loop that radiates outwards. Type `for r in [0 .. 350] by 50`.",

		{
			"hint": "Our second loop will go all around the circle, letting us draw in our pattern. Type `for i in [0 ... 2] by .1`",

This hypnotic circular pattern uses solid black and red, but the simultaneous contrast of both change our perception of both, making our brain think it sees colors where our eyes actually see sharp edges! Ozwald Boateng has ties in many different colors, try remixing the code for your own unique color combination.",
