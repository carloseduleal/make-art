His iconic suits have been worn by the likes of Will Smith and Richard Branson, and are well known for their vibrant, nontraditional colors. We’ll explore how Boateng uses color with a bit of an experiment. Set the drawing color to blue by typing `color rgb(102, 211, 231)`.",

    "completion_text": "Amazing! See how adding a different background color completely changes the feeling of the blue in the circle? It isn’t as overpowering as it first appeared. Ozwald Boateng uses tricks like this to create harmony and dissonance with his use of color. See if you can change the colors of the background and circle to bring out different emotions.",
